Restaurant Review Analysis
Overview
  * This project involves building a machine learning model for analyzing restaurant reviews. The model uses a variety of Python libraries and tools, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face's Transformers, and W&B (Weights & Biases) for tracking and logging experiments.

Dependencies
      Python 3.x
      TensorFlow
      PyTorch
      Hugging Face Transformers
      W&B (Weights & Biases)
      Pandas
      NumPy
      Scikit-Learn
      Matplotlib
      
Set up W&B:

You need a W&B account to log in and track your experiments.
Obtain your W&B API key and set it up by running:
bash
wandb login [your API key]
Usage

Data Processing
    - The script starts by fetching and processing restaurant review data.
    - It cleans the data, removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values.
    
Model Training
    - The project uses a DistilBERT model for sequence classification.
    - The training process involves tokenizing the text data and training the model on a preprocessed dataset.
    - The trained model is then evaluated on a test dataset.

Logging and Tracking
   - All the experiments are logged and tracked using W&B.
    - You can view the experiment details on your W&B dashboard.

Additional Notes
     - Make sure to adjust the file paths and dataset names according to your setup.
     - You can modify the model and training parameters in the script.
